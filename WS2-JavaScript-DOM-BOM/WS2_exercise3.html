    <h1>Conditional Location Relocation(BOM)</h1>
    <p>What kind of browser type do you have? Let's find out with BOM <br></p>

    <script>
        //window.onload makes it to run the script once the page fully loads
        window.onload =  function () {
            // variable userAgent will store what browser it is, since navigator.userAgent finds out the browser.
            let userAgent = navigator.userAgent;
            //by using the variable with includes, can make an if statement to do something based on the word we want. I could change it to chrome if wanted to.
            if (userAgent.includes("Firefox")) {
                //location.href just redirects to a page i specify
                location.href = "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/";
            }
            else { 
                //DOM just puts the text into the page, due to using window.onload earlier it overwrites the previous text made earlier
                document.write("<p> This is not a Firefox Browser, not changing pages</p>");

            }
