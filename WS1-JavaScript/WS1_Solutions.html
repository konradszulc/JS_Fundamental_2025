        for loop changes:
        1. changed 3 to arr.length since the program wants to continue the loop till all items in array counted, if the array was added or removed some items then the for loop will still account for all items because of arr.length
        2. changed <= to < this is because the loop would go an additional time and log an undefined due to the count being one higher than the index, in this example of 3: we want it to stop at item 3 when adding cause it will be index 2.
